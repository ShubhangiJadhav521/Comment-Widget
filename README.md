## Integration

To integrate the Comment Widget into your website, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Make sure you have a React application or a similar environment set up for your website.

2. **Component Import**:
   - Import the `CommentWidget` component into your application:

    ```javascript
    import CommentWidget from './CommentWidget';
    ```

3. **Usage**:
   - Use the `CommentWidget` component in your application where you want to display the comment section.

    ```javascript
    <CommentWidget commentsUrl="YOUR_API_URL" currentUserId="CURRENT_USER_ID" />
    ```

   - Replace `"YOUR_API_URL"` with the URL of your comment API.
   - Replace `"CURRENT_USER_ID"` with the ID of the current user, or provide an authentication system based on your application's requirements.

4. **Styling**:
   - Customize the styling of the Comment Widget by modifying the CSS classes defined in the `Comment.css` file.

## Usage

The Comment Widget provides the following functionality:

- Users can post comments.
- Users can edit their own comments.
- Users can delete their own comments.
- Users can like comments.
- Users can reply to comments.
- Comments are displayed in a threaded fashion, with replies nested under parent comments.

## Design Decisions

- **React**: The widget is built using React to ensure a modular and maintainable code structure.

- **Local Storage**: To enhance user experience, comments are stored in local storage. This allows comments to persist between sessions.

- **Comment Sorting**: Comments are initially sorted by the number of likes. This encourages users to see popular comments first.

## Challenges Faced

- **Styling**: Ensuring a consistent and responsive design across different websites can be challenging. The CSS classes are provided for customization, but further customization may be required to match your website's design.

- **User Authentication**: If user authentication is required for comment management, you will need to integrate it with your website's authentication system.

## User Experience and Accessibility

- The widget is designed to be user-friendly with features like editing and deleting comments, clear notifications, and responsive design.

- Consider providing alt text for the comment author's avatars to improve accessibility.

## External Libraries

- The widget uses the following external libraries:
  - `react-toastify`: Used for displaying toast notifications.
  - `react-reveal`: Used for adding animations to the widget.
  - `Material-UI`: Used for implementing material design components, styles, and icons.
